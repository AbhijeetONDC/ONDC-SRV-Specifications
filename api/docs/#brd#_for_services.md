The purpose of this document is to detail an MVP for services on ONDC, which will enable purchase of said services on the Open Network. The open network shall allow interoperability between multiple services marketplaces/platforms and is destined to expand  further in terms of participants, increasing the category of services, and adding diverse use cases in the future. 

This document is intended to be the requirements specification for any interested party to join the ONDC network as a participant under their chosen role(s). 

Mode of Service delivery:
There are two primary modes to avail the service:
1. At a location chosen by the buyer
2. At the service provider’s location

Both these flows are covered as part of the MVP.

Type of Sellers

At time of search, the buyer can be exposed to two types of sellers on the network:
1. Type A: Service Providers/Aggregators that will take an order and allocate the same to service professionals of their choosing for execution of the order
2. Type B : Service Professionals (individuals) who will directly take an order and execute it 

This is not to be confused with MSN/ISN as service providers/aggregators can be both types depending on the method by which they bill the buyer.
